        I'm a Human Systems Engineering (User Experience) major at Arizona State Univeristy. My goal is to work as a UX/UI designer for a gaming studio. I was drawn to this major by my love for rpg games and interest in design. Hopefully I can contriubte to creating an experience that users will enjoy!
